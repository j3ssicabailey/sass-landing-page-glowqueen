# GlowQueen Project

GlowQueen is a modern skin care website designed to highlight a variety of treatments. 
The website features a clean, professional design and is a part of the CSS module at Conquer Blocks.

## Description

The landing page of the GlowQueen website includes:
- A **hero section** with a call to action.
- A **floating testimonial section** with customer feedback.
- A **stats section** highlighting key features of the services, such as the number of treatments, therapists, and the use of herbal creams.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **SASS**: For CSS preprocessing and styling customization.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Vite**: For optimizing and building the project.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom SASS Styling**: SASS is used to make the CSS more maintainable and scalable, with variables and mixins for customization.
- **Interactive Elements**: The landing page includes buttons and a testimonial section to engage users.

## Usage

Once you have the project set up, open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the landing page. 

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML structure of the website.
- **scss/**: The folder containing SASS files for styling the website.

## No Contributions Needed

This project is intended as a personal project for the **CSS module at Conquer Blocks**. At this time, no contributions or forks are necessary. The goal is to showcase my skills in responsive design and styling with SASS.
